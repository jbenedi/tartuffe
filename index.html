  </div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#98846B;">
  <div class="heading" style="color: #fff;">By James Benedict</div>
  	<div class="reveal"><br>The play I have chosen for this production concept is Tartuffe by Molière, first performed in 1664. Tartuffe is a funny comedy about hypocrisy, deception, and trusting the wrong people. The play is about Tartuffe, a con artist pretending to be a deep spiritual man who tricks Orgon, a wealthy and gullible man, into trusting him completely and almost to the family’s downfall. The play’s themes of fake appearances and misplaced trust are still very relevant today.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="reveal">In my concept, Tartuffe is set in a small, rainy Pacific Northwest town in the 1990s, a time and place where grunge music, flannel shirts, and coffee shop culture were and still are everywhere, but people were also questioning authority and societal norms. It fits pretty well with the play’s themes of appearances versus reality. The setting helps create a moody and almost dreary world where Tartuffe’s false image of virtue is opposite to most of the grounded people around him.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="reveal">In this version, Orgon is a naïve business startup owner looking for spiritual guidance in a world that feels chaotic and uncertain. Tartuffe is a fake new age guru or influencer, manipulating Orgon’s need for meaning and guilt over his privilege. The rest of the family sees through Tartuffe, but they have to figure out how to convince Orgon. The production will use the gray, rainy atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest, with cozy but worn-out flannel, thrifted furniture, and misty forests, to highlight the contrast between what’s real and what’s fake in the small-town. We will see the warm interior of the house they live in, while the outside is gloomy and dark hinting at something bad lurking.</div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#B1A398;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	Religious hypocrisy was a big issue in 17th century France, since the Catholic Church had a lot of power over society and morality. Molière’s Tartuffe criticized people who used religion for personal gain, making it so controversial that the play was banned after its first performance. Tartuffe’s false wisdom and manipulation showed the dangers of blind faith to people of authority.

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#AE9A7F;">
  <div class="reveal"><div class="heading" style="color: #fff;">The Religious/Spiritual Hypocrit</div>
  <br>
	In my production, Tartuffe is a 1990s New Age guru in a small Pacific Northwest town, exploiting the people's interest in alternative spirituality. His charm is the same as in the original play’s critique of religious hypocrisy. The setting shows the culture of the time, where people looked for meaning in different spiritual movements. Tartuffe’s character would wear loose, flowing robes and carry crystals, signaling faux-spirituality while manipulating his followers.
	<br></div>
</div>

<div class="hypocrisy3"></div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#405228;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	By reimagining Tartuffe as a New Age fraud in the 1990s, my production shows the similarities between historical religious hypocrisy and modern day performative spirituality. This shows the timelessness of Molière’s play, relating with more modern audiences who are familiar with the rise of wellness and spiritual culture.  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#A7AEA6;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	Molière’s comedies used satire and farce to criticize society’s flaws while also entertaining watchers. In Tartuffe, the humor comes from the exaggerated characters, comedic dialogue, and physical comedy. This combination of criticism and entertainment let Molière address serious issues without losing his audience.

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#554633;">
  <div class="reveal"><div class="heading" style="color: #fff;">My Comedy</div>
  <br>
	In my production, the comedic elements of Tartuffe are shown by integrating 1990s pop culture references. Dorine could use sarcastic remarks referencing grunge music or tech trends. Physical comedy could have Tartuffe awkwardly messing with a cassette tape or tripping over his flowing robes during a yoga session.
  </div>
  <div class="reveal"><br>
	Using 1990s humor and cultural references like stereotypes of both grunge people and spiritual people would make the comedy more relatable for modern audiences while preserving Molière’s satire. This concept would help highlight how humor is still a powerful tool for criticizing societal norms.

</div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#A59B77;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	Baroque theater in the 17th century used elaborate stage designs, including painted backdrops, ornate furniture, and candlelit lighting. These elements showed the grandeur and formality of the French aristocratic life while still making immersive settings for the play.	
  <br><br><br></div>
</div>

<div class="stage2"></div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#8E7C64;">
  <div class="reveal"><div class="heading" style="color: #fff;">My Stage Design</div>
  <br>
	For my production, I would replace Baroque ornate with 1990s minimalism. The set could have things like mismatched thrifted furniture, random neon “Open” coffee shop signs, etc. While still being minimal, it could include more furniture than a normal house would have to show wealth. Lighting would mimic overcast skies, creating a moody, introspective atmosphere.
  <br></div>
</div>

<div class="stage3"></div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#61795F;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	My set would also feature an elaborate backdrop out the windows showing a misty forest, similar to the way baroque theaters used elaborate backdrops to create depth. This minimalist staging helps create a 1990s aesthetic while contrasting with Tartuffe’s spiritual fraud. The set highlights the contrast between the Pacific Northwest’s grounded quiet culture and Tartuffe’s manipulative and grand persona.

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#715A64;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	Costumes in Molière’s time reflected the social status and character traits of each character. Tartuffe’s clothing would have symbolized false spirituality, while other characters wore elaborate garments showing wealth and class. Props were used sparingly but were symbolic when they were used.
  <br><br><br></div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#B0A18A;">
  <div class="reveal"><div class="heading" style="color: #fff;">My Costumes and Props</div>
  <br>
	In my production, costumes would reflect 1990s fashion. Tartuffe would wear flowing thrift store type robes and beaded necklaces, while Orgon might have Patagonia vests and khakis, and Dorine would wear jeans, flannels, or t-shirts. Props like cassette tapes, coffee mugs, and yoga mats would reflect the setting and time period.
  <br></div>
</div>

<div class="costumes3"></div>

<div class="body" style="color: #eee; background-color:#746A4F;">
  <div class="reveal"><br><br>
	The costumes and props connect Molière’s critique of false morality to the 1990s aesthetic, helping to show the timelessness of the play’s themes while still grounding it in a specific cultural moment. Tartuffe’s flowing robes and crystals mimic the New Age spirituality popular in the Pacific Northwest, symbolizing his manipulation of the era and area’s obsession with alternative lifestyles. Orgon’s Patagonia vest and eco conscious clothing show his performative personality, similar to the 1990s’ obsession with looking progressive. Dorine’s grunge-inspired red flannel and boots show her as being counter cultural and skeptic, giving a contrast to Tartuffe’s fake enlightenment.
